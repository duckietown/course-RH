The duckietown platform is one of many possibilities. In particular it is used for a international competition named [AIDO](https://www.duckietown.org/research/ai-driving-olympics). You will probably have part in it in one way or the other. You need to be able to participate in it.

## Getting started {status:ready}

The AIDO book is complete and already has all the necessary instructions.

#### Setup your account and software {#exercise:setup-AIDO}

Follow the instructions [accounts needed](+AIDO#cm-accounts) and [software requirements](+AIDO#cm-sw).

## Make a simple submission {status=ready}

To first get started and understand the workflow of AIDO submission, you will submit one with its default version.

#### Make a simple submission {#exercise:simple-AIDO-submission}

Follow the instructions [here](+AIDO#cm-first).
You will have to :

- retrieve a submission repository
- submit the default solution
- monitor your submission
- explore the leaderboard

On the AIDO website, find your submissions jobs, and play around with the following parameters:

- priority : changes the order of evaluation priority amongst your various submissions
- resetting : reset a job to make it restart
- retiring : removing a job from the evaluation queue

## Customize a solution

Of course, the idea is not to submit the default solutions, but to improve them. This part is not mandatory, but you can go around and try to do better, by following the [quickstart instructions](+AIDO#quickstart-lanefollowing).
