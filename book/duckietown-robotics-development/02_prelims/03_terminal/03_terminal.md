## Using a command line {#using-commandline status=ready}

If you are completely new to working with a command line, often also called terminal or console, a beginners tutorial can be found [here](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#0). It makes sense to get to know the command line very well as this will save you a lot of time along the way.

A list of commands that are frequently used can be found in the [appendix](#useful-linux-commands).

If you are looking for an extensive list of commands that can be used from the command line, [this](https://ss64.com/bash/) is the place to look at.
