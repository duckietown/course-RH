## Run a basic program on your Duckiebot {status=ready}

Now that we know how to package a piece of software into a Docker image for Duckietown, we can go one step further and write code that will run on the robot instead of our laptop.

This part assumes that you have a Duckiebot up and running with hostname `MY_ROBOT`. Of course you donâ€™t need to change the hostname to `MY_ROBOT`, just replace it with your robot name in the instructions below. You can make sure that your robot is ready by executing the command

    laptop $ ping MY_ROBOT.local

If we can ping the robot, we are good to go.

Before we start, we need to configure the Duckiebot to accept new code. This is necessary because the Duckiebot by defaults runs only code released by the Duckietown community. In order to configure the robot to accept custom code, run the following command,

    laptop $ dts devel watchtower stop -H MY_ROBOT.local

Note: You need to do this once and the effect will be lost when the Duckiebot reboots.

Let us go back to our script file my_script.py and change it to:

<pre>
<code>import os
message = "Hello from &#123;&#125;!".format(os.environ['VEHICLE_NAME'])
print(message)</code>
</pre>

We can now modify slightly the instructions for building the image so that the image gets built directly on the robot instead of your laptop or desktop machine. Run the command

    laptop $ dts devel build -f --arch arm32v7 -H MY_ROBOT.local

As you can see, we changed two things, one is `--arch arm32v7` which tells Docker to build an image that will run on ARM architecture (which is the architecture the CPU on the robot is based on), the second is `-H MY_ROBOT.local` which tells Docker where to build the image.

Once the image is built, we can run it on the robot by running the command

    laptop $ docker -H MY_ROBOT.local run -it --rm --net=host duckietown/my-program:v1

If everything worked as expected, you should see the following output,

```
The environment variable VEHICLE_NAME is not set. Using 'MY_ROBOT'.
Adding /code/my-program to PYTHONPATH
Adding /code/dt-commons to PYTHONPATH
Activating services broadcast...
Done!

Hello from MY_ROBOT!

Deactivating services broadcast...
Done!
```


Congratulations! You just built and run your first Duckietown-compliant and Duckiebot-compatible Docker image.
