## Getting help


### `man` {#man}

This is an interface to the on-line reference manuals. Whenever you meet some unfamiliar commands, try use `man certain_command` before Googling. You will find it extremely clear, useful and self-contained.

## Looking around

### `cd` {#cd}

Go to the directory you want. If you just use:

    $ cd

then you will go to your home directory, i.e., /home/user/

To go up one directory use:

    $ cd ..

### `ls` {#ls}

List all the files and documents in the current directory. From `~/.bashrc`, we know some commonly used alias. See more by `man ls`.

-- `la` for `ls -a` which will list out all files and documents including the hidden ones(whose name starts with a dot).

-- `ll` for `ls -l` which will display Unix file types, permissions, number of hard links, owner, group, size, last-modified date and filename.

## Showing authority

### `sudo` {#sudo}

Whenever you want to modify system files, you will need `sudo`. Commonly touched system files including `/etc`, `/opt` and so on. Since most of you have followed the guideline to use passwordless sudo, I would recommend that make sure what you are doing with sudo before you execute the command, otherwise you may need to reinstall the system.


## `visudo` {#visudo status=draft}

## Giving commands

### `Ctrl + r` {#Ctrl+r}

You will face situations where you want to re-run the same command some time after you already ran it. You can of course tediously look for it by using the keyboard's arrow keys, but there is a more elegant way of doing this. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>r</kbd> and start to write the beginning of the command you are looking for. The terminal will propose the last command you ran which started with the same letters to you. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> for autocomplete and you are ready to re-run your command.


## Changing things around

### `cp` {#cp}

`cp fileA directoryB` will copy the file A to directory B. See more by executing `man cp`.

### `mv` {#mv}

`mv fileA directoryB` will move the file A to directory B. See more by executing `man mv`.
This command can be used to rename a file, to do so execute:
`mv fileA fileB`

### `mkdir` {#mkdir}

Make new directory. See more by `man mkdir`.

### `rm` {#rm}

Remove certain file. `rm -r` will also remove directories. More in `man rm`.

### `touch` {#touch}

Update the access and modification times of the input file to current time. See more by `man touch`.
It can be used to create empty documents, for example:
`touch duckie.txt` Will create an empty text file.

## Restarting

### `reboot` {#reboot}

This command must be executed as root. `sudo` required. This will reboot your laptop or Raspberry Pi. See more by `man reboot`.
