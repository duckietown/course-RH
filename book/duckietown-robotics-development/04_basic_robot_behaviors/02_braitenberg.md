## Exploring DTROS

The `DTROS` class is often referred to as the 'mother node' in Duckietown. It provides some very useful functionalities that the other nodes inherit. It has modified ROS Subscribers and Publishers which can be switched on and off. It also provides an interface to the ROS parameters of the node using it which allows dynamical changes while the node is running. For this reason we strongly suggest you to always base your nodes on `DTROS`. Instead of explaining all the details of `DTROS`, we instead invite you to investigate them yourself.

#### Exploring how DTROS works {#exercise:exploring-dtros}

First, take a look at the documentation of `DTROS` [here](http://rosapi.duckietown.p-petrov.com/repositories/dt-ros-commons/docs/source/packages/duckietown.html#duckietown.DTROS). Find out how its functionalities are implemented by looking at their implementation in the `dt-ros-commons` repository [here](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-ros-commons/tree/daffy/packages/duckietown/include/duckietown). In particular, make sure you can answer the following list of questions. To do that, it might be helpful to see how `DTROS` is being used in some of the other nodes. Take a look at [`camera_node`](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-duckiebot-interface/blob/daffy/packages/camera_driver/src/camera_node.py), the [`kinematics_node`](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-car-interface/blob/daffy/packages/dagu_car/src/kinematics_node.py), and the other nodes in `dt-duckiebot-interface` and `dt-car-interface`.

- How do you initialize the `DTROS` parent class? How do you start your node? What does `rospy.spin()` do? (_Hint: look at the nodes in `dt_duckiebot_interface`_)

- When should you redefine the `on_shutdown` method? Why do you still need to call the `on_shutdown` method of `DTROS`? (_Hint: look at the nodes in `dt_duckiebot_interface` and at the official ROS documentation_)

- What is the difference between the `DTROS` `log` method  and the native ROS logging? (_Hint: look at the `DTROS` [code](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-ros-commons/blob/daffy/packages/duckietown/include/duckietown/dtros/dtros.py)_)

- How are the parameters dynamically updated? Should you ever use `rospy.get_param()` in your node? If not, how should you access a ROS parameter? How do you initialize the parameters of your node? (_Hint: look at the nodes in `dt_duckiebot_interface` and at the official ROS documentation_)

- What does the `~switch` service do? How can you use it? What is the benefit of using it?

- What is the difference between the native ROS Subscriber and Publisher and `DTPublisher` and `DTSubscriber`?

## Basic Braitenberg vehicle behavior

Through a series of exercises you will implement a very basic brightness- and color- based controller for your Duckiebot that can result in a surprisingly advanced robot behavior. In his book _Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology_, Valentino Braitenberg describes some extremely basic vehicle designs that are capable of demonstrating complex behaviors. By using only a pair of 'sensors' that can only detect brightness, two motors, and direct links between the sensors and the motors, these vehicles can exhibit love, aggression, fear, foresight and many other complex traits.

  <img style="width:15em" src="images/Braitenberg_Vehicle.png" />
</figure>

In the image above, the light intensity detected by a sensor is used proportionally to control a motor. Depending on whether  each sensor is connected to the motor on the same or the opposite side, respectively avoiding or attracting behavior can be observed. These behaviors can further be combined if the robot also detects the color of the light.

Here's an example video of how this Braitenberg behavior would look like on Duckiebots. When the light a Duckiebot sees is green, it has attracting behavior. Otherwise, it will be avoiding. By the end of this series of exercises you will be able to create similar Duckiebot controllers. Note that while this is recorded in a dark room, with a few smart tricks you can also make your robots work in well-lit spaces.

#### Avoiding Braitenberg vechicles {#exercise:braitenberg-avoiding}

Using everything you have learnt so far, create a ROS node that implements the avoiding Braitenberg behavior. You should run this ROS node in a container running on your Duckiebot. Here are some details and suggestions you might want to take into account:

- Use the `dt-duckiebot-interface` and all the drivers it provides. In particular, you will need to subscribe to the images that the `camera_node` publishes and to publish wheel commands to `wheel_driver_node`. To do that simply make sure that the `dt-duckiebot-interface` container is running. Then, whenever you start the container with your code and `--net host`(why?), they will share their ROS Master, so that your subscribers and publishers can find each other.

- Use the nodes in `dt-duckiebot-interface` as a reference for code and documentation style. You will find a number of useful code snippets there. Also, it may be useful to visit the development book's chapter about [structuring ROS nodes](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_developer/out/dt_way_nodes.html).

- Use the [ROS template](https://github.com/duckietown/template-ros) and create your package and node there. Don't forget to add the `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt` files, and to make your Python code executable, as explained [before](#ros-pub-laptop).

- Your controller needs to run in real time with a frequency of at least 10-12 Hz. Therefore, processing the input image at its full resolution might not be possible and you should consider reducing it. A neat way to do this is to change the configuration parameters of the `camera_node` running in `dt-duckiebot-interface`. In the template node code below that is already done for the exposure mode. Consult the [ROS API docs](http://rosapi.duckietown.p-petrov.com/repositories/dt-duckiebot-interface/docs/source/packages/camera_driver.html#cameranode) and the [code](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-duckiebot-interface/blob/daffy/packages/camera_driver/src/camera_node.py) for the `CameraNode` class if you are not sure about which parameters you can change.

- For now ignore the color that your bot observes, focus only on the brightness of the image on its left and right side. If you still want to change the color of the LEDs, use the `set_pattern` service provided by the `led_emitter_node`. Its use is also documented on the [ROS API docs](http://rosapi.duckietown.p-petrov.com/repositories/dt-duckiebot-interface/docs/source/packages/led_emitter.html#ledemitternode). You do not need to call this service from inside your Python file. You would need to create a Docker container on your Duckiebot using `duckietown/dt-duckiebot-interface:daffy` as the image (why?) to run the required command. What other arguments should you use while creating this container?

- If your Duckiebot keeps on moving even after you stop your node, you will have to edit the provided `onShutdown` method. Make sure that the last commands your node publishes to `wheel_driver_node` are zero.

- You will need to publish `WheelsCmdStamped` messages to `wheel_driver_node`. You can see the message structure [here](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-ros-commons/blob/daffy/packages/duckietown_msgs/msg/WheelsCmdStamped.msg).

- The template loads the kinematics calibration on your Duckiebot so you don't need to worry about trimming your Braitenberg controller. Simply use the provided `speedToCmd` method apply gain, trim, and the motor constant to your wheel commands. However, in order for that to happen you need to make sure to mount the `/data` folder of your Duckiebot, where all calibrations are stored, to your container. To do that, just add `-v /data:/data` to your Docker run.

<!-- - You can also make use of the `dts duckiebot demo` command instead of `docker run`. It will mount the `/data` folder, setup your network and ROS environment variables, and give you access to the devices you need. To run this, simply use `dts duckiebot demo --duckiebot_name ![DUCKIEBOT_NAME] --demo_name ![DEMO_NAME] --package_name ![PACKAGE_NAME] --image ![IMAGE]`.

This command will start the `DEMO_NAME.launch` launch file in the `PACKAGE_NAME` package from the `![IMAGE]` Docker image on the `DUCKIEBOT_NAME` Duckiebot. Make sure that you first build you image on the Duckiebot! -->

- Once you have finished this exercise, you should have a Duckiebot which goes towards the left if your program senses that the right side has more brightness, and vice versa.

#### Attracting Braitenberg vechicles {#exercise:braitenberg-attracting}

You should be able to change the avoiding behavior of your robot into an attracting one by editing just a few lines of code. Give it a try! Once you have finished this exercise, you should have a Duckiebot which goes towards the right if your program senses that the right side has more brightness, and vice versa.

<end/>

#### Combined behavior Braitenberg vechicles {#exercise:braitenberg-combined}

Add a color detector to your Braitenberg controller node. If your Duckiebot sees green light (perhaps of a different Duckiebot) it should be attracted to it, otherwise it should be repelled by it.

If you have more than one robot, try to run your controller on a few of them. Set some to have green LEDs, and some red. Do you see complex behavior emerging? Changing the color of the LEDs can be done with the `set_pattern` service provided by the `led_emitter_node` in `dt-duckiebot-interface`. It is documented on the [ROS API docs](http://rosapi.duckietown.p-petrov.com/repositories/dt-duckiebot-interface/docs/source/packages/led_emitter.html#ledemitternode).

Can you devise even more complex behavior and interactions?
